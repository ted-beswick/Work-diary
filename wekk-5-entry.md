# Sprint 1

# Day 1

### Tasks completed:
- Connected the database to the code
- Designed the table structure for the project
- Implemented log in page to allow users to log in if they have an account
- Handled log in errors such as incomplete fields or incorrect data and displayed according error message
- Assisted implementation of register page and creating user accounts in the database

### Issues:
We realised we had created the project as a blazor server app rather than a blazor web app to allow us to make interactive pages so Alex and I created a new project and git repository where we transfered all of our work

# Day 2

### Tasks completed:
- Implemented the quiz page to ask questions from the database
- Code the algorithm to determine what the next question should be based on the users answers to the current question
- Redisgned the table structure to be node based, meaning that the user is asked questions in sections of three and then the next path is decided, allowing the quiz to include more questions

### Issues:
Had discussions about the structure of our databse where I had to convince my group that a redesign was necessary so that the user was asked a significant number of questions to properly understand the best career path for the individuals

# Day 3

### Tasks completed:
- Implemented the new table structure in the code, fetching the current questions from the database and calculating the next path based on the users answers
- Tested the different results of the questions to make sure that the paths are valid
- Created the code which stores the users answers to the database once the questions have been answered on that page
- Begun creating the code which checks if the user has already answered the current questions ( for example if they are going back to the previous section to edit their answers ) and pre-selects their answers

### Issues:
Attempted to allow the user to edit their previous answers but encounter issues with updating records in the database so decided to leave that for now and try to get that section of code working next week

# Day 4

### Tasks completed:
- Completed a client meeting to obtain feedback on the project so far
- Implemented some slider questions where the user can give a 1-10 answer 
- Created the code to store the sliders answer in the database
- Finished implemeting the code to load the users previous answers

### Issues:
Had trouble implementing sliders because I had to store them the same as a regular yes or no question, to resolve the issue I rolled back my git changes and started again with a clean slate, and finally managed to get it working

# Day 5

### Tasks completed:
- Begun working on star report for the first sprint

### Issues:
