### Tasks completed:
- Re-factored the algorithm to cope with changes made to the database, so that the question stores it's parents node rather than the node storing it's questions, which needed to be changed for the next section
- begun working on the algorithm for the next section of questions and begun implementation
- outlined the necessary tables that needed to be added for the next section
- implemented the code to display the correct questions on the page, which was all that could be done with the current database

### Tasks to complete before next week:
- populate the database wiht the questions for the next section - at least enough to complete one sections so that I can begin implementing the new algorithm
- research differtent roles in each department, as well as different skills that you would look for for each role
- begin creating the questions and deciding which answers would suggest which skills

### Issues:
Node table required refactoring so that the question stores the node id rather than the node storing 3 questions ids, this would mean that the next section would require new tables to work which is inefficient, so we decided to change the existing databsase, and update the algorithm accordingly.
